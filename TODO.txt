Pricing
- Subscription service that doesnt charge separately for building the website
- Just pay monthly or yearly; includes infinite revisions

Premise
- hands off online 


- what is our verb?
- what is our noun?
- speaking to businesses that need to outsource their website creation and maintenence work because they do not have expertise in house 
- better than hiring freelance web devs because they are volatile and can leave at any time
- hiring nerds means we can help with unforseen challenges
